**Title: Beer Production Time-Series Analysis and Prediction Using Deep Learning and ARIMA**

**Objective:**
The Beer production dataset provides time-series data for monthly beer production in Australia from January 1956 to August 1995. The objective of this project is to analyze the dataset, check for stationarity, preprocess the data, and apply both traditional and deep learning models to forecast beer production. The project will conclude with a performance evaluation of different models and their deployment for real-time predictions.

### **1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing**
- Load the dataset and inspect its structure.
- Handle missing values (if any) and perform data cleaning.
- Visualize the time series to observe trends and seasonality.
- Normalize/scale the data for deep learning models.

### **2. Stationarity Check**
- Use **Rolling Statistics** to analyze the moving average and standard deviation.
- Perform the **Dickey-Fuller Test** to determine if the series is stationary.
- If the dataset is non-stationary, apply differencing to remove trends and seasonality.

### **3. ARIMA Modeling**
- Obtain **Autocorrelation Function (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) plots** to identify AR and MA components.
- Tune the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model parameters (p, d, q).
- Train and evaluate the ARIMA model's performance.

### **4. Deep Learning Approaches**
#### **4.1 Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**
- Prepare data for time-series forecasting (sequence transformation).
- Build an LSTM model for time-series prediction.
- Train the model with different hyperparameters and analyze performance.

#### **4.2 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**
- Experiment with CNN for feature extraction in time-series forecasting.
- Combine CNN with LSTM for hybrid modeling.
- Compare performance with standalone LSTM models.

### **5. Model Performance Analysis**
- Compare ARIMA, LSTM, and CNN models using evaluation metrics such as:
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
  - Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
- Perform cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.
- Visualize model predictions against actual data.

### **6. Deployment**
- Save the best-performing model.
- Deploy the model using **Flask or FastAPI**.
- Develop an interactive dashboard using **Streamlit or Power BI** for real-time predictions.

### **7. Conclusion and Future Work**
- Summarize findings and discuss insights from the model performance.
- Explore possible improvements, such as transformer-based models.
- Plan for integration with business intelligence tools for decision-making.
